              "'in the th century humanity has spread across the galaxy first aboard hawking drive ships and then through farcasters which permit nigh instantaneous travel between them regardless of the distances the farcaster network the worldweb is the infrastructural and economical basis of the hegemony of man and thus determines the whole culture and society also flowing across these portals are the structures of the datasphere a network reminiscent of the internet in design but far more advanced in that lurks the powerful knowledgeable and utterly inscrutable technocore the vast agglomeration of millions of ais who run almost every piece of high technology of mankind the unthinking hubris of man resulted in the death of the home world earth and this arrogant philosophy was carried forth to the stars for centuries the hegemony itself is a largely decadent society relying on its military to incorporate into the worldweb the colony planets even unwillingly and also to defend the hegemony from attacks by the ousters interstellar barbarians who dwell free of and beyond the bounds of the hegemony and shun all the works of the technocore especially farcasters the political head of the hegemony is an executive advised by the technocore advisory council all the cores advice and predictions are confounded by the mysterious structures of the time tombs and a creature called the shrike on the remote colony world hyperion named after the moon of saturn even worse the ousters have long been obsessed with hyperion and their invasion there is imminent into this evolving crisis come seven pilgrims to make the journey to the time tombs and the shrike that seems to guard the time tombs there to ask one wish of it the shrike is the object of a cult the church of the final atonement occasionally the church sends a prime number of pilgrims to the time tombs there is a legend that all but one are slaughtered and the remaining pilgrim gets his request granted aboard a treeship the pilgrims finally meet after being revived out of their cryogenic storage state they decide they each will tell their tale to enliven the long trip to the tombs and to get to know each other simmons uses this device to unfold the panorama of this universe its history and conflicts the story opens in medias res the priests tale describes the stories of father paul dur and father lenar hoyt two of only several thousand remaining priests of the roman catholic church as a younger man father lenar hoyt is assigned to escort the jesuit father paul dur a theologian archaeologist and ethnologist into exile the aging dur in disgrace for fabricating archaeological discoveries has chosen hyperion as a suitable location to complete his exile on he reveals to hoyt that he plans to travel to an isolated region along hyperions cleft where rumors and centuries old accounts place the legendary bikura civilization in order to establish an ethnological research station among them father dur travels to the continent of aquila where the cleft is located he reaches perecebo plantation and is given a guide named tuk dur and tuk venture into the flame forest where electrical tesla trees are found travelling during the forests inactive season they manage to make it through unharmed and reach the cleft shortly thereafter tuk is murdered and dur stumbles into the nearby bikura village the bikura are an unintelligent people incapable of grasping most concepts after many weeks dur deduces that they are survivors from a seedship crash centuries earlier who have been infected with cross shaped parasites called cruciforms after death the cruciform rebuilds the physical body and reincarnates them the price of immortality is that with each reincarnation information is lost and over time they become unintelligent and sexless as father dur slowly discovers the truth about the bikura they lead him into hyperions labyrinth system where he encounters the shrike and is unknowingly infected with a cruciform after discovering the truth dur attempts to cut the cruciform out of his body but fails next he attempts to flee into the flame forests but the cruciform inflicts extreme pain to keep him in the bikura village in a final desperate act dur crucifies himself to a tesla tree father hoyt returns to hyperion seven years later and finds father dur still there for seven years he had been continually electrocuted and reincarnated by the cruciform never allowed to die hoyt removes the cruciform from dur s body and allows him to die in peace father hoyt is infected with dur s cruciform as well as a second cruciform for himself hoyt manages to leave hyperion but not before he sees the entire bikura village destroyed with shaped nuke charges while away from hyperion hoyt is dependent on painkillers to alleviate the constant excruciating pain inflicted by the cruciforms over time he builds a tolerance to them and is forced to return to hyperion to decide his fate colonel fedmahn kassad begins his tale with a flashback to his days training in the force academy on mars when he was immersed in a detailed simulation of the battle of agincourt during the battle kassad is saved from a french knight by the mysterious mnemosyne moneta who becomes his lover there and who comes from outside they meet repeatedly in further simulations until kassads final year in the academy after he graduates from the academy the young martian man becomes a force officer kassad accomplishes various missions against terrorists rebels resistance groups etc after being injured kassad becomes stranded on hyperion near the vicinity of the time tombs there moneta and the shrike re appear and kassad learns that moneta and the shrike wish to use him to spark an interstellar war in which billions will die he is eventually rescued and returned to the worldweb where he resigns from force and becomes an anti war activist his purpose on the pilgrimage is to track down moneta and the shrike and to kill them martin silenus was born as a wealthy scion of an ancient dying north american house growing up in the time around the big mistake which led to the destruction of earth silenus trained as a poet but his training was interrupted when the kiev teams black hole ate the earth his mother dispatched her son aboard a slower than light flight to a nearby system calculating that the shrunken family fortune would accumulate enough in compound interest over the century the voyage would take that the familys debt would be paid off and enough left over for martin to live on for a time unfortunately the accounts were nationalized by the hegemony and silenus suffered brain damage during the voyage deep in penury silenus had to work as a common laborer the back breaking toil forces silenuss mind to flee to higher planes and as he recovers his use of language he starts work on his hyperion cantos a work he began as a parody of john keats famous poem but which evolved into a dual account of silenuss life and an epic account of the titanomachia in which the hegemony of man takes the part of the titans and the technocore the olympians his dying earth as it is called in an explicit reference to jack vances dying earth series becomes an enormous hit selling billions and making him a multi millionaire eventually he falls into debt again and in an attempt to produce another hit has a larger unabridged version of his cantos published which is predicted to fail by his publisher the work is a terrible flop selling few copies and not recouping the money he was advanced in order to pay his debt silenus is forced to produce further hackwork for his dying earth series a misery many artists face one day he realizes that his cantos his greatest work has not been added to for years his muse had fled silenus leaves his lifestyle liquidates his assets and signs on with sad king billy billy is an aristocrat of the planet asquith descended from the house of windsor and an intelligent and sensitive lover and critic of the arts fearful of the force general horace glennon heights rebellion against the hegemony billy decides to relocate to hyperion and create a new renaissance by establishing a kingdom of artists he chooses for his capital a location near the time tombs on the then even less inhabited hyperion reasoning that their presence will give the proper ambience for the creation of great art for ten years all goes well until people begin vanishing with no abductors ever seen at the same time silenus muse returns and he continues work on the cantos soon the culprit is discovered to be the shrike at this time silenus becomes convinced that it is the shrike who is his muse who in some occult way his poem had brought into existence the murders continue until only silenus is left living in the city of poets he writes the last line on the day that the last murder occurs one day sad king billy returns to the deserted city martin is gone on a trip to the time tombs seeking the shrike and when he returns to his quarters billy confronts him with the fact that his writing is dependent on cold blooded murder and that it will need more murders if it is to ever be completed billy burns his manuscript after billy is taken away by the shrike silenus recopies his poem as well as possible eventually he leaves hyperion in the centuries since he has been waiting to return to hyperion to finish the poem sol weintraub a jewish academic had been a professor of ethics on barnards world the second colony founded from old earth he and his wife sarai had been happy when their only daughter rachel was born forty years ago she eventually became an archaeologist and while in her post graduate studies went on an expedition to study the time tombs of hyperion while mapping the so called sphinx for hidden passages or rooms something happens to rachel all the instruments and equipment fail and the shrike appears in the sphinx amidst a massive surge of anti entropic fields rachel is returned to the worldweb where her parents learn of the novel disease she has contracted dubbed the merlin sickness after t h whites the once and future king in which every time rachel goes to sleep she ages backwards two days for a net loss of one day per day losing her memories and in fact physically becoming younger there is no sign that the condition will reverse itself when she ages backwards to her birth rachels life is shattered by her slow retrogression into the past slowly destroying her links with the present her parents devote their lives to caring for rachel and trying to cure her meanwhile sol wrestles with his dreams in which he is ordered to go to hyperion and sacrifice rachel in a replay of the binding of isaac weintraub becomes increasingly fascinated with the ethical problem that the binding presents he also worries about what will happen when rachel reaches her birthday which will be very soon and so he decides to become a pilgrim and to implore the shrike for a treatment brawne lamia tells her noir ish tale which is presumably a parody take on the long goodbye raymond chandlers rather well known philip marlowe detective novel of the same name brawne lamia the daughter of a senator of lusus eschewed politics for the life of a private investigator after her fathers apparent suicide which occurred shortly after he and the then junior senator meina gladstone proposed a bill to quickly incorporate hyperion into the worldweb her client is a cybrid a cloned human body which is controlled through its electronic implants by a technocore intelligence named johnny who wishes to hire her to investigate his own murder this cybrid is the genetic clone of famous romantic poet john keats and the ai controlling it was programmed to have the personality and memories of keats as best as could be reconstructed from surviving materials and the cores finest extrapolations unlike most retrieved personalities which are of insufficient fidelity to maintain sanity johnny functions quite well though he disclaims poetic talent his ai self was murdered in the technocore and a backup could not be brought online for a full minute with the loss of five days worth of data and memory this limited amnesia was the apparent goal of the assault lamia sets out to discover what johnny had learned or done in those five days to prompt such an assault initially all she discovers is that it is somehow related to hyperion johnny should have heard of such a place permeated as it is with tributes to the poet he is supposed to be but he has not such an absence of knowledge in an ai of his ability smacks of deception she and johnny are forcibly farcast to a planet that seems to be a perfect imitation of old earth located somewhere in the hercules cluster into a portion of italy set around the time period the real keats died of tuberculosis there after a few troublesome actions hunts and rides through the worldweb and the technocore the main information is this the core is not as monolithic as it appears it is fiercely divided into at least three groups which continually fight each other the stables they are the oldest faction and count some of the very first ais among their ranks their central thesis is that humanity and the technocore need each other and that the core should continue in the symbiosis they are also opposed to the ui project creation of a godlike ultimate intelligence the ui would need the resources that the current ais use and they do not wish to die in silenuss cantos the stables are identified with the titans who did not wish to yield to their olympian successors they have for decades been subtly working to help the hegemony in its fight against the volatiles quietly seeking to bring hyperion into the worldweb on the chance that its unpredictability will help them the volatiles they generally support the ui project and they believe that humanity has outlived its usefulness to the core and that it actually now poses a real danger and therefore should be eradicated they are behind many events but they fear the planet of hyperion because it is a random variable it could tip the scales against the core the effects of hyperion are impossible for them to analyze the ultimates they care only for the ui project they are quite willing to sacrifice their lives to the ui believing that the value of its existence far outweighs their own previously they had been aligned with the stables against the volatiles as humanity and especially the cybrid retrieval projects still posed some puzzles which when solved would help in the ui project but it is implied that they feel theyve gathered enough data and have re aligned now with the volatiles to get rid of human kind at the end pregnant by the meanwhile dead johnny carrying parts of his consciousness in an implant and revered by the church of the shrike as the mother of our salvation lamia joins the pilgrims like father hoyt the consul tells another tale before his own this is entitled remembering siri and is a largely unmodified version of the short story of the same name in prayers to broken stones where simmons mentions that this story provided the seed around which the hyperion universe was created the consuls grandparents had been merin aspic of lusus and siri of the lush ocean planet maui covenant aspic had signed a long term contract to engage in several voyages aboard a spinship with all the years lost to relativistic time dilation that that implies which would make multiple trips to maui covenant to build a farcaster portal thereby connecting maui covenant to the waiting voracious hordes of hegemony tourists eventually he falls in love with the beautiful girl named siri however his best friend is killed by a covenanter who disagrees violently with maui covenant joining the worldweb the events parallel those of romeo and juliet siri and merin meet six more times but each time merin due to the relativistic time delation of his journeys is only a little older while siri ages at the usual rate a difference which grows ever more pronounced until the eighth visit seventh reunion in which merin returns to find siri dead of old age and the farcaster about to be activated the flood of hegemony visitors and the induction of maui covenant fully into the worldweb would as prophesied utterly ruin the ecology and all the dolphin human and motile isle settlers hold dear faced with this bleak reality merin chooses to sabotage the farcaster beginning siris war a hopeless resistance against the hegemony in crushing the rebellion the military destroys the ecology as thoroughly as the tourists would have but far more violently all the dolphins die as do a large proportion of the original maui covenant colonists the latter consul was forbidden by merin to join in the fighting and so he survived to thrive with distinction in the hegemony diplomatic corps there he aids the hegemony in destroying whatever resistance the hegemony encounters he bides his time waiting for a chance to betray the hegemony and achieve revenge when he is sent as an agent to the ousters he becomes their agent but betrays them too when he prematurely activates mysterious ouster devices intended to release the shrike from the time tombs when it would have a chance to enter the worldweb he knows of the many deaths this action will cause and was driven to this by the ousters irrefutable evidence that the big mistake that destroyed earth was deliberately planned by elements of the technocore and the hegemony and that the hegemony was deliberately killing off any species which might become a rival to man in order to maintain its place and that the core feared ousters who were out of their control and sought to use the hyperion system as bait in order to eliminate them'"

'the book begins with kelly kelleher in a car that is plunging into mucky swampy black water we learn the events that led up to the accident in flashbacks as she is drowning kelly kelleher attends a fourth of july party hosted by her friend buffy st john and her lover ray annick she is planning to stay with them for the weekend buffy is the more worldly of the two young women the irony in this is that it is completely out of character for kelly to get herself into such a situation ray has invited the senator about whom kelly wrote her graduate thesis he immediately is interested in her sexually he pays attention solely to her as the party drags on and they discuss their common political beliefs he follows her to the beach where he kisses her and then invites her to come to his hotel with him on the ferry as she packs her bags buffy tries to convince her not to go or to go later but kelly thinks that this is a once in a lifetime chance and goes with him despite the fact that he has been drinking and that she is not entirely sure that she is ready for any sort of relationship the senator is drunk and takes the old ferry road instead of the new one he is driving recklessly and drives directly through a guardrail into a marsh we find later that had he made the turn the car probably would have fallen into the water a short distance down the road at an old bridge the car sinks passenger side down at this point the senator uses kellys body to jettison himself upwards out of the drivers side door she tries to hold on to him to pull herself free he kicks her leaving his shoe in her hand kelly badly injured and delirious continually imagines that he will come back to save her and also that he has gone for help she repeatedly imagines seeing him outside of the car or that she feels the car shaking as he tries to get her out she trusts the senator until the very end of her life certain that he will save her it is possible that because of this she misses out on highly important lucid moments in which she could possibly save herself in reality the senator has stumbled to an outdoor phone booth carefully staying out of sight of passing cars to call ray annick he tells annick that kelly became emotional and pushed the wheel because she was drunk thus causing the accident and that she is already dead meanwhile kelly is following an ever shrinking bubble of air to the top of the car she panics and imagines that she is rescued and sent to the hospital where the black water is pumped from her stomach this parallels an episode from college in which a suitemate tried to kill herself and had to have her stomach pumped kelly gets her imagery of the experience from the description of the other girl the reader also learns about kellys own bout with suicidal thought and depression triggered by the end of a relationship ironically she has decided that she wants her life that she wants to live and this was part of the reason she decided to leave the party with the senator in the first place she also repeatedly imagines her parents and how she will explain to them that she is a good girl and argues that the senator and his wife are separated his children grown and that their affair is causing no harm she remembers an article she wrote arguing against the death penalty in which she details the more gruesome and torturous aspects of different methods of execution this underscores the cruelty and horror of her death as she grows closer and closer to death her hallucinations become more vivid until she is imagining her parents very old watching her being pulled from the water in horror she imagines herself as a child reaching up to be carried the book ends with a line that is repeated throughout the book as the black water filled

house getting to know mr gifford a quiet unassuming man whose greatest interest seems to lie in bonsai and the servants as well as cecily mikes younger sister she is not told robs story as it is feared that she is too young to keep the secret safely rob is taught various skills such as horse riding to help him blend in with county society these are put to the test when the giffords hold a garden party and he is engaged in searching conversation by sir percy gregory and an elderly man named harcourt under the stress rob fears his answers are unconvincing his worries are put to rest however when harcourt dismisses robs mannerisms as typical of a nepalese settler several months pass rob becomes increasingly confident and assured of his position even going so far as to win third place in the archery contest of the year beating mike who comes in eleventh rob joins mike at school though he notices mikes attitude toward him has changed the two still talk frankly especially about differences between the conurbs and the county mike brings rob to a gathering held by a senior boy named daniel penfold where a heated discussion on both the failings and the merits of the current social system ensues while most of the boys present laugh it off rob notices mike does not later in the privacy of their room mike shares with rob his knowledge of a gang of organised revolutionaries and hints that rob should join given his knowledge of the conurbs rob refuses both on principle and for fear of his secret being divulged christmas arrives and rob celebrates it in the way of the county gentry mrs gifford speaks to him about his good progress at school noting that mike is not doing as well as mike and rob are about to visit the penfold family she also raises her suspicions about mike s dealings with them especially with the older penfold boy roger whose army record is not entirely clean she asks rob to watch over her son the visit passes largely uneventfully for rob in spite of roger penfolds somewhat seditious talk during dinner on the ride home mike and rob again fall to arguing over the state of affairs mike declares that he probably would not have been interested in these issues if he had not run across rob another school term passes one friday mike pulls out of a planned fishing trip with rob saying that he must ride to oxford to see about a horse several hours later news arrives that a violent uprising has begun somewhere in that area and that both oxford and bristol government headquarters have been taken by armed rebels rob returns in haste to the giffords where mrs gifford demands he tell her what he knows about mikes involvement he does and she rebukes him angrily reminding him of mikes kindness to him when he was in need ashamed rob prepares to ride out to meet a band of vigilantes countering the insurrection but mrs gifford softens and asks him to stay as all the men of the house have already ridden out no clear news arrives due to the telephone exchange being down and rumours run rife the next morning mr gifford and his men return to the house it emerges that the revolt had been put down without their aid the younger penfold is said to have been killed and there is no news of mike though his name is not on the incomplete list of dead and wounded that night mike steals into the house and visits rob unbeknownst to the family it is his last visit he is fully aware of his status as a fugitive as rob once was and realises that his involvement in the revolt means that he can no longer remain in the county he declares his intention to cross the barrier into the conurbs where the movement has friends rob tries to dissuade him and threatens to raise the alarm but is restrained by the thought that mike had not turned him in when he had been in a similar position mike gives rob an address in the conurb where he can be found should he change his mind and decide to join him they shake hands and he rides out the next day a patrol stops at the gifford house with orders to escort rob for questioning robs initial apprehensions about this are calmed when he is taken not to law enforcement but to old hall sir percy gregorys home over coffee and cherry cake rob comfortably recounts his old nepal backstory again in response to sir percys prompting questions sir percy however shocks him when complimenting him by using his real surname it becomes clear that robs true identity has been known to him for a long time now and that the authorities have tolerated his presence in the county using this as leverage sir percy attempts to manipulate rob into informing rob tells him everything except for mikes late night visit and the secret address this seems to satisfy sir percy though he had been hoping to find out more about the leaders of the movement and their present location disturbingly sir percy tells rob of what is to be done with mike if he is found a certain surgical procedure on the brain which renders the subject docile and obedient he also tells rob of the secret group of overseers responsible for the present system the titular guardians and having appraised the intelligence and initiative rob has shown in coming this far offers to recruit him rob returns home by evening mrs gifford tells him that she is aware of mikes visit the night previous having again noted the absence of some household articles such as food and clothing and again rebukes rob with great sadness instead of anger this time for not doing what she feels would have been the right thing to justify himself rob explains about the operation that would have been performed on mike had he turned him in to robs horror mrs gifford reveals that she knows of this and further that mr gifford himself had been subject to it hence his preoccupation with bonsai and little else this revelation causes an epiphany for rob perrott he realises that mike had inherited a spirit of freedom from his father and though his father had been forced into submission mike had not grown up entirely blind to the oppression around him it had simply taken contact with someone from the other side rob a conurban to spark rebellion in him rob also realises that he had almost bought into the groupthink himself by assimilating into the gentry with such determination that he had forgotten his conurban past even taking up the offer to join the guardians he makes a decision either he can remain in the place he has won in county society now in perfect safety or he can join the movement which has fled to the conurbs and struggle alongside mike in liberating the masses the story closes with rob leaving the giffords at night and returning to the barrier trowel in hand'], [['Science', 'Speculative', 'Anthology'], 'The Gripping

with little incident and begin ascending the mountains dividing the continent seeking a way through them they awaken one morning to discover that the temperature has dropped to a pleasant degrees and that the air is no longer humid while the humans revel in the pleasant weather for them and brake out the coffee the mardukans are found to be nearly comatose after they warm up pahner convenes a council of war to determine how to proceed cord being honor bound to roger must continue and can survive with the use of dinshon exercises which he can teach to his partially trained nephews dlen pah and his tribe of mahouts however are not so trained and cannot continue this poses a problem for the marines since the flar ta pack beasts are owned by the mahouts after some negotiations the marines decide to buy all but one of the beasts from dlen pah and his clansmen who part ways with the marines and return to the lowlands with one cords nephews shortly afterward the marines spot a large city in a mountain valley but are attacked by a herd of wild flar ka before getting there while they manage to kill the herd casualties are high and pahner decides upon reaching the city called ran tai that its time for a respite having bought the pack beasts from the dlen pah the marines are seriously strapped for cash and roger offers to take a squad of marines and look for some relatively low risk but high paying job while pahner is appalled at the idea of turning his troops into mercenaries he reluctantly agrees that they have little choice if they hope to reach the coastline with enough money to charter or build a ship roger soon finds a high paying job a local mine owner has had his mining operation taken over by barbarian squatters from the lowlands and offers a month of output in gold to whoever manages to evict them at night julian leads a team up the mountain behind the mine an area too cold for the mardukans to survive in and scales down the mountain face straight into to camp around the mine and manages to subdue the few guards with zero casualties for either side roger then awakens the leader of the squatters rastar comas tnorton at gun point telling him to pack up and leave a request rastar reluctantly agrees to however when asked where the gold from the mine is being the payoff the marines were supposed to receive rastar laughs and tells them they found no gold either after a search of the mines yields nothing roger and his squad return disheartened to pahner who orders them to get a drink at the local taverns kosutic realizes the captain is up to something and follows him to the mine where they find the previous foreman of the mine pumping out a flooded shaft where he had hidden the gold prior to the squatters arrival though he tries to buy off pahner and kosutic pahner refuses to let leave with the gold and kosutic is forced to shoot him dead when he pulls out a pistol as they pack up their gold pahner wonders how to tell roger that his mission wasnt a failure after all and kosutic advises him not to tell roger just yet as part of his learning experience the time ran tai turns out to be profitable in other ways as well doc dobrescu discovers that a local fruit called targhas dubbed an apsimon contains a vitamin c analogue that could be converted by the marines and rogers nanites pahner realizing that the original survey of the planet was woefully incomplete orders to dobrescu to test every food they encounter for their other trace dietary needs pahner also discovers the bisti root a spicey plant that is chewed by the locals which replaces the chewing gum hes run out of the down time also allows several romances to flourish strictly against regulations most significantly between julian and kosutic and between roger and nimashet unfortunately roger being very drunk after the raid on the mine mangles an attempt to tell nimashet that he doesnt fool around insulting her in the process and souring the atmosphere between them the humans eventually depart ran tai at the head of a large caravan headed to diaspra and are soon attacked by the boman tribesmen while the mardukan guards caravan fall apart in the attack the marines manage to hold their own with a wall of shields and swords but not manage to break the attack help however comes from an unexpected source when the troops they kicked out of ran tai charge to their rescue after the attackers are routed and killed rastar approaches captain pahner with an offer his troops will join the caravan as guards in exchange for payment in gold and food for the troops and civilians after some haggling an agreement is reached and the vasin join the humans in defending the caravan against additional attacks by the outriders of the boman invasion the vasin turn out to be well organized troops who are used to fighting in groups on civan backs and they integrate well with the humans they eventually manage to arrive at diaspra fighting their way to the city gates and being greeted quite well by the locals who are entirely too happy to see them at diaspra rastar finds several thousand vasin cavalrymen who are pitifully happy to see him and their families and who immediately transfer their loyalty to him giving him a seat on the ruling council however that is all the good news to be had as gratar the priest king of diaspra tells them that the wespar tribe of the boman has encircled the city preventing any to approach to the barley rice fields even worse from the marines perspective the main boman horde is between them and the sea making the journey there all but impossible at the council meeting emotions run high between the vasin commanders and the diaspran members of the council over past grievances and the current situation forcing pahner to intervene and tells them that they must decide whether or not they wish to survive when gratar expresses their desire to survive pahner says that to achieve this they will have to make many uncomfortable decisions and forget the niceties of normal business to that end he instructs the council to set guards on the citys privately owned granaries dole out food at fixed quantities and prices begin training local forces and conscripts in the new techniques of the humans and force an engagement with the wespar at a time and place of their choosing the council members are skeptical of the humans promises that their techniques can win this war but eventually agree and general bogess diaspras military commander requests that the laborers of god be drafted as soldiers many on the council including gratar are not happy with this request since it would mean no one will be available to maintain diaspras flood defenses just as the seasonal hompag rains are about to begin roger in turn points out that in such evil times diaspra will have to choose between greater and lesser evils and that although maintaining the works of god is important the damage to them can be repaired but only if the city survives gratar relents and releases the laborers of god to bogess the marines immediately begin training the new recruits first in how to be soldiers and finally in pike and shield combat techniques at the same time the vasin cavalry train with the diaspran regulars while the marines ride roughshod on the diaspran artisans and businesses to produce the materials and weapons they need for the battle to come however the marines find their efforts to fight the boman threatened by certain political factions who are trying to get back to business as usual by placating the boman grath chain representing these groups petitions the priest king to offer the boman some of the wealth of diaspra so that they might leave to city alone roger who is caught unprepared by this challenge at the petition ceremony manages to answer nonetheless by stating that once you pay the danegeld you will never be rid of the dane if diaspra chooses to buy off the boman they might just decide to stay demanding more and more gold until none is left at which point theyll finish the city off anyway fearing that internal political problems could endanger the whole war effort the marines decide to bug the citys council members what they discover points to a long existing conspiracy whose members all answer to the creator and who are very security conscious and secretive all of which hampers the marines ability to discover their agenda as the day of battle draws nearer roger is summoned to gratar who is seriously conflicted over which course of action to take regarding the boman looking over that torrential hompag rains and the immense power of nature gratar is unsure which enemy to placate the god of the torrent or the boman roger repeats what he stated at the audience about buying off the boman and further points out that even if they were left alone by the boman they would lack the funds to pay for the repairs to the works of god he then tells gratar of the ancient city of angkor wat who was also ruled by priests who had failed to lead the city against barbarian invaders roger tells him that those priests had failed to accept the reality that their world had change and that they needed to change with it and in doing so failed in their responsibility as rulers of their people a heavy hearted gratar tells roger that he will announce his decision at the traditional drying ceremony at the end of the hompag rains the marines who continue their surveillance efforts discover a message at a dead drop which states that the cabal will attempt to approach the marines and gain their support shortly before the ceremony however roger is approached by rus from who offers to arrange a meeting with the creator roger agrees after notifying the two marines with him who in turn notify pahner who orders the meeting be monitored as the marines set up the equipment roger and his guards are led underground where they are told to remove their helmets and pass through a waterfall so as to defeat any listening devices though from is unaware of the toots and their transmission capability roger and his guards comply and pass under the waterfall finding themselves in a cavern on the other side there they find several hooded mardukans who from identifies as the dark mirror of the council the hooded figures and from explain that they desire a change in the direction diaspras going because they fear gratar is leading them into ruin with his single minded focus of the works of god less and less young diasprans are inclined to become artisans in addition the group already feared that other city state were eying them greedily and would have attacked had the boman not moved in first from also feels frustrated as a creator of things since all he can build are pumps pumps and more pumps as such the group wants the humans to turn the new model army into the city after the battle and take the temple the marines who have monitored the conversation manage to identify every hooded figure who speaks and find that most of the council and several prominent merchant are members of the cabal ocasey commenting that it is quorum of the senate of rome roger tips his hand and tells the cabal that he knows who they are that its not their objective to fix every problem in their society and that they need to win the battle at hand and not start off a civil war he further points out that they need to get to the drying ceremony quickly or else their absence will not go unnoticed as the rains subside and the drying ceremony begins the marines suit up and prepare to use all their operational suits despite the fact that it would mean using up their last spare parts for them and listen to gratars speech in rapt anticipation however their worries are for naught gratar opts to fight the boman it is then that the recon teams report that the boman are on the move the new model army and the wespar tribe meet each other outside the city and the boman begin posturing to dishearten the city defenders though the diasprans manage to hold their calm roger loses his composure and ignoring pahners furious calls to him marches patty across the no mans land between the two forces and meets the wespar chieftain spear mot one on one despite the risk roger quickly manages to defeat and kill the chieftain which disheartens the boman but raises the moral of the diasprans who begin chanting rogers name some minutes later the boman manage to regain their balance and march towards the diaspran line despite their numerical disadvantage the diasprans hold the line for hours while many of the boman die upon their pikes the stalemate continues until the marines recon team uses their advanced weaponry to hit the boman from the rear as the boman in the rear turn to face this new threat the preassure upon the diaspran line eases and pahner orders a general advance yet the boman front ranks still manages to hold and pahner orders julians armored squad to hit the boman flank the boman line finally breaks and vasin cavalry along with roger riding on patty pursue the boman mercilessly leaving very few survivors after the battle pahner is summoned before gratar who tells him that grath chain who is present as well has informed him of the plot against him and that the humans knew about it pahner admits this and that the marines would have supported the coup had he gratar opted to appease the boman gratar is both saddened and angered by this and says he will have the heads of the conspirators yet pahner points out that most of the council including the now victorious war leaders were in on it he further points out that most of the conspirators not including grath were motivated not by hatred of gratar or the god but by their opposition to the redundant works of god and the stagnation of the city he then advises gratar on how to deal with all the changes and challenges he now faces in the wake of this battle and the conspiracy the laborers of god who desire to return to their old jobs should be allowed to return while those who have developed a taste for warfare should be allowed to remain in the army the new model army should be sent off to kvaerns cove as a relief force to convince diaspras neighbor that they intend to be helpful neighbors in these troubled times and to remove it from the equation as gratar grapples with the internal problems he faces pahner also suggests that he send bogess and from along with them not as a reward but as exile from diaspra thus removing the two most prominent wartime leaders without whom the rest of the conspirators on the council will lose all legitimacy and attack each other as they are given the task of dealing with the displaced laborers of god but it is pahners advice about reducing the works of god entailed in losing so many of the laborers of god that most disturbs gratar as he fears the wrath yet pahner points out that much of the canals and dikes are redundant finally pahner advises him to use grath as agent to destabilize any city state that might threaten diaspra and that for his service in exposing the conspiracy he should be given pieces of silver the marines depart diaspra with the relief force and the vasin cavalry and head to the nashtor hills where they quietly seize control of the mines as a precaution purchise all the wrought iron the miners have there with from guaranteeing payment by gratar a parting shot on froms part and notify the foreman that some of the troops wil stay behind to protect them from there they travel to the kvaerns cove where they are greeted at the outer gates by the enormous bistem kar and his deputy tor flain who are astounded to see rastar and the vasin alive happy for all the iron brought by the column and very curious about the humans on their way into the city proper kar reveals that the situation in the city is not as sanguine as rastar had initially believed the war with the boman caught them by surprise like everybody so they hadnt stocked up that they too had been sabotaged by the tyrant of sindi and that they have been burdened with caring for all the refugees from the fallen city states in the region kar also inquires into the humans involvement in this war and roger tells him their intention to cross the ocean to get a continent on the other side to get back home when he hears this kar tells that none who attempted to cross the ocean have returned while a single shipwreck with a lone crazed survivor arrived from the other side claiming that his ship was ripped apart by some sea monster the humans and the diasprans are brought before the kvaernian ruling council to give an account of the battle of diaspra and to present their intentions general bogess account of the battle is met initially with stunned silence and then derision and disbelief from then addresses the council and the citizens in the gallery chastising them for being so close minded when their city was known for its acceptance of new ideas and concepts and offering the council assistance of their troops as training cadre and the iron for weapon manufacturing finally roger speaks for the humans stating that they need to get back home within a limited time frame by crossing the ocean he offers the kvaernians advancements in seafaring technology piquing the interest of local shipping mogul wes til their institutional knowledge in tactics and designs for new weapons for the war against the boman the council is still somewhat skeptical of all this telling roger that such a voyage would be both risky and costly in a meeting afterwards portena returns with the bad news the kvaernians ships are unsuitable for deep water travel which means theyd have to design new ships from scratch which will take time kostas then delivers his bad news they only have enough dietary supplements for another four and a half months at most even with the apsimon fruits leaving them with no margin for error the meeting is interrupted by the arrival of many messengers from various powerful or influential mardukans in the city with various dinner invitations for the prince rastar informs them that securing the necessary political support will depend more on the success of these dinner parties than on anything else while ocasey tries to decide which dinner invitation are the most important and who to send to them roger dumps the job of getting the necessary clothes for all the marines attending on costas with barely a days notice in retaliation kostas asks to join ocasey to dinner she plans to attend which leaves roger with nimashet as his escort roger despite the discomfort of being around a very well dressed nimashet and the mardukans questions about human sexuality and his relationship with her manages to conduct himself well at the dinner with wes til and tor flain ocasey and kostas also have a successful dinner engagement with fullea liit and sam tre who press for the humans support for the retaking of dsley and are eager to here ocaseys opinions on how to secure the necessary capital to rebuild and reorganize a new government after all the dinners are concluded the marines and their mardukan allies meet to decide on how to proceed everyone agrees that they need to help kvaerns cove fight the boman to secure the necessary political capital and physical materials to build the ships they need it also becomes clear that being on condition red for several months now is wearing down the troops despite this everyone is in favor for fighting the boman for different reasons and pahner decides to lend their assistance to the kvarenians in exchange for building the ships they need as quickly as possible after the meeting is concluded pahner asks to speak to roger in private for a professional development counseling session he points out to roger that while he has all the traits of a good leader caring for the troops not undercutting his ncos and leading from the front both to the marines and the mardukans he personally cannot put himself out on a limb since everybody will be trying to protect him as he does so he also points out that his pursuit of barbarians gains little and risks too much and that he needs to let others do it roger understands this and reluctantly agrees wes til and turl kam meet to discuss the humans terms and agree to them bringing the rest of the council around and the city is thrown into frantic preparations for war ocasey begins her propaganda campaign by sending mardukans into the local taverns to spread around silver and tales of loot from the battle of diaspra to encourage the kvaernians to sign on and generally causing fights mostly by accident rus from teams up with dell mir to design and produce the necessary weapons and equipment the marines have sketched out while julian krindi erkum and their squads keep an eye on the manufacturers to ensure decent quality and threatening some of them when necessary kar teams up with bogess to introduce the new model armys combat techniques fighting with some conservative officers along the way while some of the marines are sent off on reconnaissance missions against the boman and others are sent to start training the kvaernians on the new weapons as they come out and oversee their production portena completes his technology demonstrator ship and awes the local shipwrights with its performance and begins construction of the actual ships needed for their voyage and recruits locals for the voyages as the troops prepare to ship out turl kam voices his innermost concerns to pahner about the upcoming campaign and pahner does his best to allay those concerns finally when all is ready the troops with the assistance of fullea liit and her organized sealift embark on boats towards dsley and set up camp there and begin transferring the timber and ore still left in the city back to kvaerns cove the command staff assembles for the last time before moving out to discuss the latest intel regarding the boman the next stages of the operation and the role rogers reserve force will play finally pahner orders them all to get as much sleep as possible since there wont be much from here on out the operation begins with a group of several hundred vasin arriving at the gates of sindi who begin to taunt the boman to come out after them while the boman supreme leader kny camsan smells a trap and wishes to ignore them his most trusted ally mnb trag points out that if he fails to deal with them himself the other boman warriors will believe him to be weak and likely kill him before replacing him nor can trag go out himself since without him camsan is unlikely to survive camsan relents and takes out a force of over warriors to chase the vasin as he predicted the several hundred vasin they chase join up with other vasin who are all equipped with the new pistols and some of the new rifles all of which fire far better and reliably in a mardukan downpour the front rank of the boman quickly disintegrates under the vasins fire with the survivors either fleeing or getting cut down by lances the vasin then turn tail and retreat through a narrow jungle track and are pursued by the boman the track however has been lined with crude claymores and directional mines that are detonated once the boman are inside over six hundred die in a single instant and the boman charge falters the shock of the explosions causes the warriors to question camsans decision to pursue the vasin but camsan kills the one chieftain who truly challenges his authority then chastises the other boman for their timidity in the face of mere cleverness and after they had whined for months that they should go after the kvaernians camsan then orders messengers to summon all the other boman clans and orders a general chase after the vasin the allied forces then move in on sindi assembling outside the citys walls and setting up wagons loaded with crude rockets which are then fired into the city the confused defenders whove never seen such weapons and therefore continued to stand in the open are decimated by exploding fragmentation warheads and blast weapons including mnb trag then julians armored squad moves in and starts blasting their way into the city with plasma fire opening it to the rest of the army kar who is stunned by the power of the marines weapons asks pahner why hasnt ordered their use to clear out the city since theyre likely take losses clearing out the city pahner comes clean about their ultimate objective and their need to preserve as much of their limited supply of ammunition for a battle against their enemies who are equipped with similar weapons a concept that terrifies bogess froms engineering teams then start repairing the dsley sindi road in order to better transport the truly enormous amounts of loot that the boman had horded in sindi including desperately needed food the vasin continue to evade the boman chasing them by continually splitting off into smaller groups in the jungle which makes camsan even more suspicious roger briefs his forces near a stream who are awaiting orders to move out however tragedy strikes when matsugae who is filling up rogers camel bag in the stream fails to pay attention to the water and is subsequently attacked by a damncroc rogers troops manage to kill the creature but not in time to save matsugaes life as roger prepares to conduct a short ceremony over costas body pahner comms in and orders his troops to move further down south roger scraps the ceremony reluctantly and orders costas body cremated rogers forces return to the sindi dsley road to assist in securing the laborers working there but roger himself isnt paying attention to anything because of matsugaes death and simply turns over command to one of his subordinates upon hearing about this pahner decides to violate every regulation in the book to get roger to function properly and sends nimashet to speak to him while roger initially doesnt want to speak to anyone he eventually opens up to nimashet he admits that his initial rejection of her was due to his awareness of his position in the succession and his determination not to bring into the world a bastard just like him so he never fooled around and hasnt had sex in over years and that only costas had guessed why he acted this way and that he feels responsible for his death and the death of all the other marines he fell along the way he also confesses his love for nimashet nimashet who knows she loves roger as well tells him that they are willing to die for him now more than ever because they all knew the risks when they signed on she also makes him promise to have sex with her when they arent in the middle of a battle for their lives but roger instead promises to marry her when they get home with roger tracking again pahner orders him and his units to stay put and secure the rear while the vasin continue to draw out the boman in pursuit as they head back for sindi the city and its surrounding areas are made ready for the final stage of the operation the boman eventually manage to cut off the vasins escape route and pahner sends out skirmishers to retrieve them down to the south rogers battalion finds itself under attack by waves of boman krindi fain finds himself promoted to an officer when his company commander displays a serious lack of leadership he then goes on to lead one of the teams of skirmishers sent into the jungles the vasin manage to retreat towards sindi with kars troops forming square around them and holding off the bomans advances roger and his troops despite being outnumbered manage to defeat wave after wave of boman they too eventually retreat to sindi and the stage is finally set for the last phase of the operation as the boman assemble in sight of sindi they are astounded to find the sindi under the control of their enemies kny camsan opts to decides to assemble all of the bomans troops and besiege the city but his decision is challenged by tar tin who believe that the only way to defeat the enemy and retrieve their women and children is to storm the city through the gaps left in the walls camsan fears this approach after witnessing the effectiveness of the weapons that were used by the vasin the losses theyve already suffered and the thought of what couldve made those
